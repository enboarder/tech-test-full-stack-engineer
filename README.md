# We are building a space airport - Tech Challenge

We have been very busy for the past 12 months building aircraft hangars, digging safety tunnels and shafts, closing deals with NASA, SpaceX and ISA. Everything is almost ready and as a consequence of our partnership with SpaceX, we need to build our Ground Control flight dashboard to support their needs.

Elon Musk’s engineers have provided us with the specs of their APIs and you can find it here https://docs.spacexdata.com

## The dashboard requirements

### Frontend focus role

If you are applying for a Full Stack Engineer (Frontend focus) role, please follow the instructions [here](./README-frontend.md)

### Backend focus role

If you are applying for a Full Stack Engineer (Backend focus) role, please follow the instructions [here](./README-backend.md)

## Getting Started
We have provided a bit of boilerplate code that you can use to get started.  You are **not** required to use this boilerplate, so feel free to throw it all away and start fresh if you prefer.

The boilerplate code assumes you have Docker running on your machine.  If you do not, they offer easy to install binaries ([Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)) ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)).

From the docker folder of the project, run `docker-compose up -d`
* You should now have the UI running at http://localhost:3000 and the server running at http://localhost:4000
* You should now have a MySQL database running at localhost:3306

**The time recommended is 1-2 hours, try not to spend longer than that, we don’t want you to waste a precious day of your life over this. More importantly, you do not necessarily need to complete every point, we want to see how you work and how far you get, we are not actually sending rockets into space (not yet).**

**Please commit your code to Github and share the link with us.**
