# We are building a space airport - Tech Challenge

We have been very busy for the past 12 months building aircraft hangars, digging safety tunnels and shafts, closing deals with NASA, SpaceX and ISA. Everything is almost ready and as a consequence of our partnership with SpaceX, we need to build our Ground Control flight dashboard to support their needs.

Elon Muskâ€™s engineers have provided us with the specs of their APIs and you can find it here [SpaceX API docs](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs#rspacex-api-docs)

## The dashboard requirements

### Frontend focus role

If you are applying for a Full Stack Engineer (Frontend focus) role, please follow the instructions [here](./README-frontend.md)

### Backend focus role

If you are applying for a Full Stack Engineer (Backend focus) role, please follow the instructions [here](./README-backend.md)

## Getting Started

We have provided a bit of boilerplate code that you can use to get started. You are **not** required to use this boilerplate, so feel free to throw it all away and start fresh if you prefer.

The boilerplate code assumes you have Docker running on your machine. If you do not, they offer easy to install binaries ([Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)) ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)).

First you will need to install the dependencies using npm. The starter project has been structured to separate the browser application and the server application into separate folders. To install the dependencies for both applications, run the `npm intall` command from the "client" and "server" folders respectively

To run the project, use a cli tool to open the "docker" folder within the project, then run `docker compose up -d`
* You should now have the UI running at http://localhost:3000 and the server running at http://localhost:4000
* You should now have a MySQL database running at localhost:3306

**The time recommended is 2-3 hours, try to complete as many of the requirements as you can during that time, but don't worry if you cannot complete every point or if your solution does not feel "production ready", we are more interested in seeing how you approach the implementation of the base concepts and problem solving.**

**Please fork this repository, commit your code to your forked copy on Github and share the link with us.**

**Note: this submission must be your own work. Do not copy / paste or use AI.**
